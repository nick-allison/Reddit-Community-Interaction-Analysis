# Reddit Community Analysis Project

This repository contains a detailed analysis of communication patterns between various Reddit communities (subreddits). Using a combination of advanced data mining techniques and graph algorithms, the project seeks to reveal insights into which subreddits are the most influential, how they interact with each other, and what patterns emerge from these interactions.

## Project Overview

Reddit hosts thousands of interconnected communities (subreddits), each contributing to a larger ecosystem of shared information and discussion. By analyzing the flow of messages between subreddits, we can identify the most influential communities and uncover important patterns in their communication. 

The core goals of this project include:
- Identifying central or influential subreddits within the dataset
- Using graph-based algorithms to map out interactions between communities
- Discovering clusters or sub-communities that may share common themes or users

This analysis equips me with practical experience in handling complex datasets, cleaning data, and applying machine learning and data science methods to uncover meaningful insights, which directly translates to work in AI or Data Science.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into seven main folders, each containing Python scripts that perform specific computations on different subsets of the data. Each folder includes a `README.md` file that explains the purpose of the computations performed within.

**Note:** The dataset itself has been excluded from this repository due to size constraints.

## Skills & Technologies
