Just like with Page Rank, I decided to split the data set up by year and calculate the in and out degree for each year.

I copied in my clean data file from part 2 of the project and modified my Python file from part 4 to split the data up by year and output an in and out degree file for each year.

I found that the output followed along with some of the trends that I noticed previously: political subreddits became more and more significant in the network context even after the election, and in degree tends to be somewhat similar to page rank.

This part of the project was a success.
