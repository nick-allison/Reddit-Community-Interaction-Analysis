At this point I wanted to switch gears, and do some analysis of the communities that subreddits can form with one another.  I thought it would be interesting to treat a subreddit like an individual and try to identify communities between subreddits.

I thought that it would be iteresting to start by trying to find max cliques, so I copied over the appropriate clean data file and wrote a simple Python program that took advantage of the networkx library to calculate the max cliques for the graph.

I let my program run for several hours, however, and it was not able to compute this.

This part of the project was unsuccessful.
